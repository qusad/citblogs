I've been waiting for a long time to get to AWS. I have a lot of friends who graduated recently and all got good jobs in the cloud computing sector. I am very interested in AWS and cloud technologies. 

I was so excited that I finished my portion of the first project in a couple of hours. I got a domain for 99 cents, created the Ansible playbook, and set up the  GitHub. I created a Project in GitHub and added all the tasks that we need to complete. I added a few more over time as there were more things to do. 

Getting the domain was simple and so was setting up Route53 DNS.  We got the 4 Amazon Nameservers and put them into the custom DNS of the domain registar. My teammates set up the VPC, EC2, and everything else AWS. Amazingly, my playbook worked from the first try. The site is now online at - novaprospekt.xyz. The last thing to do is to set up a TLS certificate and make a presentation.
