This semester is looking good so far. I am excited about learning more about AWS and possibly getting a certification. For this semester's project, we decided to play around with relational databases and security for starters. We want to look into more advanced topics and implement them as we go. 

We will take our previous project as a base for the web/application server and will need to reasearch AWS RDS - relational database service. We are planning on having a robust log in system with all the industry standards in terms of security and recovery. I had another idea of creating a Dropbox style application using AWS. During my research, I found out that Dropbox used to exclusively use AWS as their storage which makes sense. They've built their own cloud and moved away from AWS to save money.

I have another idea using AWS Elastic Container Service to have a Build-a-Bear style application which allows you to use a web portal to pick and choose features and tools and then spits out a ready made docker container. I have no idea of the feasibility of this idea, but I will take a look into it.
