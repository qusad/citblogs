Week 2 has been uneventful since we finished 90% of the project during the first week. The only tasks that were left over where the TLS/SSL certificates and the powerpoint presentation. We were able to get the certificates from AWS and the setup was pretty easy. We only had a problem with redirecting HTTP to HTTPS. After getting the certificates, only HTTPS version worked, and not regular HTTP. After messing with it for some time we got both versions to work but still could not redirect the query to HTTPS from HTTP. We tried both via the server config files and AWS Load Balancer.

Lastly, we were able to get all the documentation in order for each of the important parts: ansible, site, AWS. Getting used to using Github for pull requests with multiple people took some time since I set it up so that I manually have to  approve each request. Next project will be much easier since we are getting used to work as a team on the project and with Github.
