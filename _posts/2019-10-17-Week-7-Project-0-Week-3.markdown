Nothing technical has happened this week due to the fires near CSUN. The project has been finished since last week and there was nothing else to do. We finished the presentation and double checked the code for the site. This will be a short blog because there isn't much to talk about. It would be great if the next project was posted so we can prepare for it and not be behind in class.

In the meantime I was checking out terraform and seeing what it does. I didn't completely understand it and hoping that the next lecture will shed more light onto it. I believe the next project will be on terraform and it should be interesting.

EDIT: We have ran into some huge problems with the Load Balancer the day before class. Something broke on the server, domain, or the site which caused the site to go offline. It looks like the Load Balancer has found some issue with the site and shut it down. We were able to resolve the issues about 10 minutes before it was our turn to present. Now I understand the definition of crunch time.
